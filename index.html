            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <h3>The exploration of extraterrestrial life faces challenges amidst captivating discoveries. Meteorite revelations showcase sugars like ribose, suggesting the potential interstellar transfer of crucial building blocks for life on Earth. Beyond molecular insights, NASA's pursuit of habitable exoplanets unveils promising prospects, emphasizing the importance of habitable zones in the cosmic search.</h3>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>In the grand tapestry of the universe, humanity's quest for understanding extends beyond our terrestrial boundaries. Recent scientific endeavors have unearthed intriguing evidence that suggests the potential for life beyond Earth or, at the very least, the components necessary for its existence.</h3>

            <h2>Controversy Surrounding Alien Sightings</h2>
            <h3>While popular culture has long associated UFO sightings with potential evidence of alien existence, the scientific community contends with a lack of empirical substantiation for such claims. Notably, instances of reported UFO sightings frequently lack robust evidence and are susceptible to fabrication, as demonstrated by historical cases, such as the 2003 hoax orchestrated by Tom Callen, a producer for Cosmonova, took fake sightings of UFOs <sup><a href =#ref1>(Callen, 2003)</a></sup>. Even with the limited technology in the early 2000s, Callen was still able to produce convincing fakes. With the more advanced photo editing, generative AI, and just equipment overall, it is extremely easy to deceive people. Given the prevalence of misleading incidents, it is imperative to prioritize scientifically validated findings to ensure a credible and rigorous exploration of the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</h3>
            <h3>UFO sightings, as portrayed in the media, lack solid evidence and can divert resources from legitimate scientific endeavors. Instances of UFO hoaxes, such as those created by Tom Callen in 2003, underscore the ease with which technology, including photo editing and generative AI, can deceive the public. To ensure a credible exploration of extraterrestrial life, it is essential to rely on scientifically validated findings.</h3>

            <h2>Evidence of Extraterrestrial Life:</h2>
            <h3>There have been promising evidence suggesting that there is life beyond Earth or at least is capable of inhabiting life. One of these being the discovery of certain sugars such as ribose in meteorites. Ribose is a key building block for RNA which is important because meteorites might have brought organic molecules, like sugars, to early Earth. The presence of these extraterrestrial sugars suggests they could have played a role in creating important compounds like RNA on our planet. This suggests that there may be other planets like earth that have formed similar compounds <sup><a href =#ref3>(Yoshihiro et al, 2019)</a></sup>. However, these compounds would not mean anything if there were not the right living conditions. <br><br>It's important to note that while these compounds are significant, the existence of the right living conditions is equally crucial for the development of life.</h3>

        <section id="identification">
            <h2>The identification of habitable planets</h2>
            <h3>From our current understanding of life, we can only assume that the environmental conditions needed to support life is similar to life we have on Earth.</h3>
            <h3>NASA has been actively involved in the search for habitable exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system. The concept of habitable zones is crucial in this pursuit. Habitable zones are regions around stars where planets are neither too hot nor too cold, making them suitable for the potential existence of liquid waterâ€”an essential ingredient for life as we know it <sup><a href =#ref2>(NASA, 2023)</a></sup>.</h3>
            <h3><br>Temperature:<br><br>As stated, water is a crucial for there to be life. The temperatures on these planets determines the state of water and so is quite important we know what the ranges of temperatures we must look for. <br><br>Organisms whose intercellular materials consists of water can actually grow and reproduce even below waters freezing point. This occurs when the freezing point is decreased by salts and other solutes. Psychrophiles or cryophiles are extremophilic organisms that have been seen to grow and reproduce in environments as low as -20 degrees celcius <sup><a href =#ref5>('Psychrophile',2020)</a></sup>. On the other hand, many planets that have been discovered have high temperatures which is why it is important to know the upper limits of life. A methanogen has been shown to grow and produce methane at 122 degrees celcius where the pressure is high <sup><a href =#ref6>(Christopher P.McKay, 2014)</a></sup></h3>
            <h3><br>Water/Dryness:<br><br>In environments where the temperature falls within the aforementioned range, the potential for life still may be constrained by the accessibility of water. Countless studies have shown minimal precipitation in the form of rain, fog, snow, or even atmospheric humidity can prove sufficient for photosynthetic processes, resulting in the development of a modest yet observable microbial community.</h3>

                <figcaption><sup><a href =#ref4>(Seager Sara, 2013)</a></sup> In the figure, the light blue region represents planets with atmospheres containing nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O), while the yellow region indicates drier planets with humidity as low as 1%. This categorization helps scientists identify planets with conditions that could support life. <sup><a href =#ref6>(Christopher P.McKay, 2014)</a></sup></figcaption>

            <h3>In the figure above we can see the the zone where Earth is in which enables water to stay in liquid form on a planet, given it has the right atmosphere.</h3>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <h3>Habitable planets may offer new resources that are scarce or depleted on Earth. Accessing these resources can contribute to technological advancements and economic growth, as well as help alleviate pressure on Earth's limited resources.</h3>
