            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <h3>The exploration of extraterrestrial life faces challenges amidst captivating discoveries. Meteorite revelations showcase sugars like ribose, suggesting the potential interstellar transfer of crucial building blocks for life on Earth. Beyond molecular insights, NASA's pursuit of habitable exoplanets unveils promising prospects, emphasizing the importance of habitable zones in the cosmic search.</h3>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>The contemplation of extraterrestrial life and the exploration of exoplanets, celestial bodies orbiting stars beyond our solar system, has long been a controversial topic. </h3>

            <h2>Controversy Surrounding UFO Sightings</h2>
            <h3>Media often portrays extraterrestrial life as UFO sightings, however, there have not been solid evidence proving these are real. Such occurrences can impact advancement as it may divert resources from legitimate scientific endeavours. It has been proven that these encounters are also easily faked. One such example is when Tom Callen, a producer for Cosmonova, took fake sightings of UFOs (Callen, 2003). Even with the limited technology in the early 2000s, Callen was still able to produce convincing fakes. With the more advanced photo editing, generative AI, and just equipment overall, it is extremely easy to deceive people. Due to there being so many misleading in these cases, I will stick to more evidence-based findings.</h3>
            <h3>UFO sightings, as portrayed in the media, lack solid evidence and can divert resources from legitimate scientific endeavors. Instances of UFO hoaxes, such as those created by Tom Callen in 2003, underscore the ease with which technology, including photo editing and generative AI, can deceive the public. To ensure a credible exploration of extraterrestrial life, it is essential to rely on scientifically validated findings.</h3>

            <h2>Evidence of Extraterrestrial Life:</h2>
            <h3>There have been promising evidence suggesting that there is life beyond Earth or at least is capable of inhabiting life. One of these being the discovery of certain sugars such as ribose in meteorites. Ribose is a key building block for RNA which is important because meteorites might have brought organic molecules, like sugars, to early Earth. The presence of these extraterrestrial sugars suggests they could have played a role in creating important compounds like RNA on our planet. This suggests that there may be other planets like earth that have formed similar compounds (Yoshihiro et al, 2019). However, these compounds would not mean anything if there were not the right living conditions. Habitable zones, where the planets are neither too hot nor too cold due to the distances to their stars (NASA, 2023), have been in  </h3>
